# Co-Libate

This is an example application integrating React Native and GunJS.

# Premise

Let's say at a wine-tasting party, a group of users taste a wine together, adding characteristics (including flavors and scents), and upvoting characteristics.

You will be able to navigate to a wine and see what characteristics it has; and from a characteristic and see what wines have that characteristics. 

# Tech

The graph is stored in GunJS to enable real-time updates and storage of the taste <> wine graph.
